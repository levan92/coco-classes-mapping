# Mapping from COCO 91 classes to COCO 80 classes 
As described [here](https://tech.amikelive.com/node-718/what-object-categories-labels-are-in-coco-dataset/), the original research [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0312) has 91 object classes while the published [dataset](http://cocodataset.org/) only had 80 classes. This simple repo provides the mapping between the two intersecting sets of classes. 

## Why you might need it
Some predict functions might output their classes according to the 91 classes indices for purpose of coco eval (for example, when running `detector test` on COCO-pretrained Yolo with [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)), even though they were trained on 80 classes. You might need to map the idx between the two sets.  

## The 2 sets of classes
The `*.names` files contain the list of classes for each set. Note that even some of the class names are different, for example "aeroplane" vs "airplane". These differences are hardcoded in `map_coco_classes.py`.  

## Mapping
The idx mapping from 80 classes set to 91 classes set (& vice versa) is generated as the `*.json` files, generated by `map_coco_classes.py`.
